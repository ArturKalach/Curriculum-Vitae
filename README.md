# Artur Kalach </br><sub>Senior Software Engineer</sub>

## Summary
I am a senior software engineer with more than six years of experience in IT. For the past three years I have been working for EPAM and specializing in `ReactNative`. Lately, I have been working mostly with: `ReactNative`, `React`, `Jest`, `TypeScript`, `Firebase`, `GraphQL`. Working on RN includes developing native modules and components which I usually write in `Swift`, `Objc` and `Java`. Regarding the tools I have used and have experience in: `DevAzure`, `AppInsights`, `Appcenter`, `Flipper`, `FastLine` and others.

My experience includes work with other technologies, despite the fact that I used them in production, I have not practiced most of them for a long time and my seniority can be lower than expected: `Redux`, `Redux-thunk`, `Redux-Saga`, `StyledComponents`, `Sass`, `Vue`, `Vuex`, `XState`, `PWA Vue`, `Webpack`, `Lerna`, `Fastline`, `PHP`, `Laravel`, `MySql`, `Redis`, `PuTTY`, `JQuery`.

## Teamwork
Teamwork is important and I am used to working in big teams (more than 30 people) and I have good experience of working alone or in small teams. The previous project included a lot of teams and members, I guess 16 plus teams and 500 plus people in an account managed by SAFe principles. I have worked and followed SCRUM, SAFe, and NEXUS methodologies and principles, and I know other methodologies theoretically.

I had an opportunity to team-lead, but need more time and tasks to hone these skills. I have team-lead four-five people a couple of times, held SCRUM meetings, and solved issues. As a team-leader, I am trying to achieve balance between customer satisfaction and code quality. I am considered to be a good mentor, interviewer, moreover, I onboarded new team members to projects and made knowledge transfers.

## What I am looking for?
I love my work and complex challenging tasks.
I am interested in improving my skills and experience, learning something new, and working with challenging tasks from technical and management sides.
